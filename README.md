The Challenge - Predict Natural Disasters

This yearâ€™s challenge was to build state-of-the-art technology to predict and prevent the impact of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods. codefundo++ participants have a four-week immersive rhythm to learn and build solutions.

What we did was to make an app that can predict in real time whether their is any chance of flood or elicitation of drought in any part of the country at any given time depending upon the rainfall in that area over a period of time. We use standard ML protocols and models for making this Flood Predictor

The data for training was taken from the govt of India, its open source in JSON format. Also the real time data of rainfall from all over the India was taken from Indian Meteorological Department
